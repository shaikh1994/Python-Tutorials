Write a program/script that takes a directory path as input, read all the files in the directory and print the filename (ignore the file extension e.g. ".txt") in order based on the number stored in the file. You may write the program/script in any programming/scripting language of you choice.
Examples:
$ python program.py ./testcase1
output: team
$ java program ./testcase1
output: team
$ program.exe testcase2
output: friend
